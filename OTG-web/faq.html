  Q. Why drink H10O? </span><br />
     H10O is a much healthier alternative to sugary soft drinks and other flavored juices and waters. H10O provides a unique combination of 10 Essential Natural Vitamins specially formulated to address the specific needs of women and men with NO SUGAR, NO CARBOHYDRATES and ZERO CALORIES. Plus, it counts towards your daily water intake.
 <p><span class="bold">Q. H10O contains zero sugar, than what is it sweetened with?</span> <br />
    H10O has 0 Calories, 0 Sugars and 0 Carbs.  The sweetener used in  H10O is Sucralose  - more commonly known as Splenda, the preferred healthy choice for sweeteners. Sucralose is 600 times sweeter than sugar therefore, only a small amount is needed, and  it is not absorbed by the body like sugar, so you can enjoy a guilt-free, good for you, great tasting, refreshing beverage.</p>
  <p><span class="bold">Q. How many  flavors does H10O  offer?</span><br />
      H10O  offers 6 distinct flavors. The Flavors were chosen  after extensive research on gender preferred flavors. <br />
    3 for Women – Peach Mango Tea, Berry  Sport and Tropical Energy and, 3 for Men – Lemon Tea, Citrus Sport and Orange  Energy. <br />
  H10O  is a refreshing, lightly flavored enhanced water  beverage that uses the finest 100% natural flavors and does not contain any  dyes or carbonation.</p>
 <p><span class="bold"> Q. In addition  to the 6 different flavors, what is the difference between the Tea, Sport and  Energy?</span>
  H10O offers 3 specific blends for each gender:<br /></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Teas contain: naturally occurring caffeine.</li>
    <li>The Sports is more of a pure blend with  no caffeine.</li>
    <li>The Energys contain: an ideal blend of Caffeine and Guarana (Gwa ra nah) Seed Extract to provide a mild, long lasting  energy boost, without any sugary  crash.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="bold">Q.  What is the difference between the Women’s and Men’s formula?</span><br />
    Founder -  Max Recone decided to offer H10O for Women and Men because he felt there was a need for gender specific Essential Vitamin waters. Both Women and Men formulas contain 10 Essential Vitamins, with  2 of those 10 being different between the women and men.<br />
    All Women’s formulas contain:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Vitamin B-7 – an important vitamin in the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats </li>
    <li>Vitamin B-9 – an energy and metabolism booster</li></ul>
   <p> Men’s formulas contain: </p>    
    <ul>
      <li>Vitamin C – a strong anti-oxidant that also builds collagen which builds stronger bone, muscle and cartilage
      </li>
      <li>Vitamin B-2  – which activates other vitamins to convert carbohydrates to energy in the body
        </li>
        </ul>
<p><span class="bold">Q. Can men drink the women’s blend and vice versa?</span><br />
  Of course!  All the ingredients are safe for anyone to consume. However, the 2 different Essential Vitamins may provide slightly more benefit to one gender than the other.</p>
  <p><span class="bold">Q. Does drinking H10O  replace the need for a multi-vitamin?</span><br />
    No. No vitamin water on the market can provide the full spectrum of the recommended daily vitamins. Some vitamins are fat soluble and simply cannot dissolve in water. H10O provides hydration and a unique combination of  vitamins that tastes good, looks good.</p>
  <p><span class="bold">Q. Why does H10O cost more than Vitamin Water?</span><br />
      More  vitamins. Better packaging - bottle tint, UV stabilizer and labeling.</p>
  <p><span class="bold">Q. Some bottled waters use tap water, what about H10O</span>  <br />
    Our  bottler, Adirondack Beverages of NY is ISO 9001 Certified. Adirondack uses naturally pure water from an underground reservoir called:” The Great Flats Aquifer”, <u>NOT</u> municipal water. The Aquifer water is then filtered  using the “Reverse Osmosis” method to remove any chemicals or dissolved minerals such as iron or calcium prior to making H10O to insure that H10O is as pure as possible.</p>
  <p><span class="bold">Q. What is the  difference between H10O and other Vitamin Waters?</span><br />
    H10O  has 0 Calories, 0 Sugars and 0 Carbs. H10O has 10 Essential Natural Vitamins. H10O  has Natural Flavors. H10O uses The Great Flats Aquifer water which is then filtered; Not tap water. H10O offers gender specific vitamins, and, H10O  has 6 great tasting flavors!</p>
